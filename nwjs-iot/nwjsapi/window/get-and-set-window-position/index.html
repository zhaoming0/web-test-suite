  <li>Click "Move To (0, 0)" button, then click "Get Position".</li>
  <li>Click "Move To (200, 200)" button, then click "Get Position".</li>
  <li>Click "Move To (-512, -384)" button to verify that negative position argument is converted to (0, 0), then click "Get Position" .</li>
  
</ol>
<p>
  <strong>Expected Output:</strong>
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Current window position is got.</li>
  <li>Window is moved to left-top and the current position is (0, 0)(or equals screen pixel minus toolbar).</li>
